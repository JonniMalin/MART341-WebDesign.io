      <h2>Layna: Puppy Pic!</h2>
      <p>This is Layna, my <dfn title="a working breed commonly used in police and military work"><u>Belgian Shepherd Malinois,</u></dfn> when she was a puppy. It's so easy to forget she was ever that small.</p>

      <h3>Layna: All Growed Up!</h3>
      <p>This is Layna after she grew a bit. She was always a goofball. I always referred to her ears as her "solar panels" because that had to be how she always had energy.</p>

      <h4>Bonus Layna Picture!</h4>
      <p>Bonus: My favorite photo of Layna. She was essentially an ESA for me, and the way she was looking at me in this photo is how I knew she was taking care of me. We could have entire interactions nonverbally, but she was always listening.</p>
