1. Universal selector is used to style everything; it does not distinguish any part of the document from any other part unless overridden by changes or precedence. Element selectors style content based on the tags used; for example, a <div> tag or a <p> tag. A class selector is used to style everything that shares the same class type/name; This allows for the formatting/styling of anything with the same class, which could be used to group like with like on a web page. The id selector is unique for each element, and would be used to style unique, individual parts of a web page.

2. I chose earth tones, along with a teal and a blue, because they are somewhat complementary. As browns and earth tones share a good deal of yellow, and yellow complements blue, I thought they would go nicely together. (Also, I play video games and have a few online characters with these colors for their armor palette; you'd be surprised at how nice blue and gold look together.) The hex codes for the colors I used were:
    #FFE4B5
    #8B4513
    #008080
    #2F4F4F

3. The biggest challenge with this assignment was the position attribute within CSS. It'll take me some practice to understand it fully, and I don't know how effectively I'll be able to use it in my final project, but I'll try my best.
