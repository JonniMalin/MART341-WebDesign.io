    <p>Anna Sewell only published one novel in her life: Black Beauty. To this day, the  novel is considered among the "top ten best selling novels for children" despite the fact that Anna intended for adults to be reading it. Black Beauty had only been published for five months when Anna passed. Her original goal when writing Black Beauty was to encourage people, particularly those who worked with horses directly, to be kind and compassionate toward their animals.</p>
