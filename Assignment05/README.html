1. I chose Youtube for my Wayback visit. Compared to today's more streamlined site design, the old version looked a lot busier. Now it seems that the site has either removed a lot of buttons and features, or placed those buttons/features behind other menu options. This makes the site feel less cluttered.

2. These last few topics haven't been bad at all. I've actually had some _very_ limited experience with html when making comments and other posts on DeviantArt; users had to use html for fonts, links, and other such tasks when writing or commenting, so that past experience may have helped some of this new material "stick" better for me. The hardest thing to remember so far has been the order in which to put the four main document elements in my html documents. I imagine that will get easier with time, though. Taking notes helps, too.
