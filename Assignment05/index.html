    <h1>Black Beauty</h1>
    <h2>Anna Sewell</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>So, I'm not sure if the instructions for this particular section were meant to include the actual text from the story in question, but it's a long one because I learned to read at a <i>very</i> young age, so I figured I'd just say a few things about the story itself: Black Beauty began my interest in "animal stories" as a kid. To this day, I still occasionally re-read it. In fact, I still have the original copy of "Black Beauty" that I received from my grandmother for my birthday when I turned nine years old. It also inspired me to read more of the same kinds of stories, and other favorites include titles such as "White Fang" and "The Call of the Wild." I'd like to try my hand at writing such a story one day.</p>
