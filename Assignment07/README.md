1. I've filled out a myriad forms on the web. the username and password form is undoubtedly the most common, but I've completed questionnaires for jury duty, forms for the VA, comments sections and "journals" on social media sites, and so on.

2. An example of text would be the "enter comments here" areas that some forms have; the purpose of such a form is to gather information beyond the closed-ended questions that can be answered with the other input types. Selection would be a radio button, drop-down, or check box. They're best used for closed-ended questions that don't require elaboration from the user.

3. My work cycle for this assignment required me to go back and review the material more than the others, so far. I had to go back and forth to the "form" section multiple times. I ended up bookmarking just about every external link on forms, too. Definitely need to review this area. Otherwise, I simply followed the directions, in order. That's how I do assignments.
