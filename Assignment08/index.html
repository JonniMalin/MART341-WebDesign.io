      <h3>Lyrics</h3>
      <!-- This song doesn't actually have lyrics because -->
      <!-- it is a musical composition my brother wrote. -->
      <!-- Instead, I will use a poem that I wrote. -->
        <p>
        <!-- I tried the <pre> element to past this poem, but -->
        <!-- it was giving errors and wouldn't resolve in -->
        <!-- the Markdown Preview window, so I worked around it. -->
        When the sky trips and leaves a smattering of stars<br />
        Across the cosmos<br />
        The plasma and nebulae will coalesce into something<br />
        Greater than us:<br />
        Churning sky-fire of roiling violence that shall<br />
        Melt our world<br />
        Into scattered chips of mosaic-glass<br />
        <br />
        We will be boiled down into the pale transparency of<br />
        Our own feckless values<br />
        And the prism-shards will belie the dep opacity of<br />
        The blood we spilled<br />
        In the name of our gods, who we called<br />
        Peace and Freedom

       I do not own "Dirge of the Empty Tombs". It was used for a school project.
