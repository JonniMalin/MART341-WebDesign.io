# Johnelle DiTonno MART341-WebDesign
Repository for intro to Web Design &amp; Development homework.
Changes for Week 2 include the addition of a homework file and relevant screenshots. (If you read this, Professor, the course website included the interactive material for adding/manipulating website repositories in GitHub, and every time the student was asked to click somewhere in their repository, the instructions erroneously referred to the "right" side of the page as the "left" side. ;)
